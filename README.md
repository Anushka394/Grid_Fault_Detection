PID Tuning Simulator (Made with MATLAB)

This is a simple and fun project where I built a PID tuning simulator using MATLAB. If you're into control systems, or just curious about how tweaking `Kp`, `Ki`, and `Kd` affects a system's behavior â€” you're in the right place!

What This Project Does

It simulates a PID controller on a basic first-order system and lets you:

- Try different values of Kp, Ki, and Kd interactively.
- See how the system responds to a step input.
- Get performance details like overshoot, rise time, and settling time.
- Automatically save the plot of the response for reference.

How to Use It

1. Open MATLAB and go to this project folder.
2. Run the script:
   "matlab"
   pid_simulation

Why I Made This

Control systems have always fascinated me. I even got an S grade in my control systems course! So, I wanted to do something related to the subject...a way of saying thank you to this field.
